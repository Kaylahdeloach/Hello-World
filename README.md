				This is my first webpage! I was able to code all the HTML and CSS in order to make it. I hard a very hard time trying to figure out how to make this webpage. But thanks to the help of Google and the Github guide. I was able to figure it out! Watch out world of web design here I come!

				I can use my skills here to create websites for my business, my friends and family, blog or articles. As well as any games or more experiment stuff (which is what the web is really all about).
